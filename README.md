# SEA_tottag_scripts
Repo for TotTag proximity data scripts. 
The goals for Spring 2021 is to create a python script that produces the following from the testing log file:
1) Identify 'check-ins' from proximity data based off distance and time within a certain distance interval
2) Identify window of time around event (arrival time vs. departure time)
3) Identify each window of interaction by who initiates interaction (which tag from pair approaches the other and for how long)
4) Identify whether there is motion for a timestamp
5) Link motion and proximity data per timestamp

## How to clone:
### Please refer to this handy tutorial github has created: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

## Don't forget to `git pull`!
Once you have your github repository set up on your local machine, **always make sure** to `git pull` before making **any changes**.
This will ensure that if someone else has contributed to the code base while you were not active, their changes are reflected in your local repository, this helps later on down the workflow pipeline when pushing code (github will give you an error if you try to push to a branch that has changes not seen in your local repo).

## scripts/Analysis 
### (this code is from https://github.com/lab11/socitrack/tree/master/software/analysis)
Scripts used to analyze the downloaded TotTag log files. To begin, run the tottagAverager.py script, which takes at least 3 arguments: the starting Unix timestamp, the ending Unix timestamp, and a list of every log file that you would like to average together. The data is averaged accross timestamps by dyad, so the measured value at a certain timestamp from one TotTag is averaged with the value at the same timestamp from its companion TotTag. The script can be run like so:

`python tottagAverager.py START_TIME_VAL END_TIME_VAL LOG_FILE_1 LOG_FILE_2...`

Next, run the tottagSmoother.py script, which takes at least 2 arguments: the number of data points over which to smooth, followed by a list of every log file you would like to smooth. The smoother works by taking a moving average with a width of SMOOTHING_VAL. When it encounters a gap in the data greater than the aforementioned value, the smoothing buffer is cleared and it starts over after the gap. To run the script, enter:

`python tottageSmoother.py SMOOTHING_VAL AVERAGED_LOG_FILE_1 AVERAGED_LOG_FILE_2...`

Now, your data is ready to go, and you can begin running the tottagStats.py script on it. This script produces summary statistics on the smoothed log file. The statistics it outputs are the amount of time each dyad spent within 3ft of one another, the amount of time the TotTags were in range of one another, and the number of times a dyad re-enters 3ft after leaving it for at least 30 seconds. The input for this script is simply a single log file:

`python tottagStats.py SMOOTHED_LOG_FILE_1`

## scripts/analysis.py
### this code is currently being developed by the Spring 2021 data analysis team led by Dr. Virginia Salo
to use `analysis.py` run: 

### Before you install libraries, make sure you have pip installed
Refer to this website for details (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Pip should already be installed with installation of python but to be sure, run `pip -V` to check which version you are running.

### How to install libraries needed in `analysis.py`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage of analysis.py:
To use analysis.py you must first run the motion.py script on each log file, this file can be found within the /Analysis folder. 
For the motion.py file use : `python3 motion.py file_name` to process the logfile and the output should be a `motion_file.csv` file which will be used as input for the analysis.py script below.

`python3 analysis.py logfile_name <motion_file_1.csv> <motion_file_2.csv> ... <motion_file_N.csv>`

### Usage of `smoother-analysis.py`:
This script is a combination of `tottagAverager.py`, `tottagSmoother.py`, `motion.py`, and `analysis-df.py`. 

This script accepts 4 inputs, the first input is the smoothing value, and the rest are log files to smooth and analysis. Note that the first input log file should be the one that you want to do analysis on. 

This script first average the log files and produce an averaged file for each log file, it then smooths all the input log files and output a smoothed file for each. Next, it does motion analysis on each log file and produce a motion data file for each. It finally does an analysis on the first input log file.

This script outputs 10 files, including 3 averaged files, 3 smoothed files, 3 motion files, and 1 analysis result. 

The script is run like this:

`python3 smoother-analysis.py smooth_val logfile_name1 logfile_name2 logfile_name3`
