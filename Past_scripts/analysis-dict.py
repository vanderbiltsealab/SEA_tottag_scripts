"""
Command to run this script looks like: python3 analysis-dict.py DATAFILE MOTION1 MOTION2 MOTION3 ...

Unlike later scripts that mainly use pandas data frames to process data, this script mainly uses dictionaries 
to process data. And since that introduced some back and forth logic into the script, and pandas also provides some 
predefined functions that are useful for our processing, we switched to using data frames for most of the processing.

This script does not include initial motion process, averaging, nor smoothing. 

The final output of this script numbers check-in occurrences. 

It does not fill in all timestamps from the start of the DATAFILE to its end but only includes those where
proximity data exists
